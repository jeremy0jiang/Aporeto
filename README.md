#Thoughts and concerns in the projects

##Problem 1
1.In bash shell script, I read command line flags and output usages in my own way.That is, in problem 2 and 3, I read flags use go's built-in flags class, which is more convenient.
2.I do not quite understand why we need prompt "File removed", since we only need to overwrite file if it exists.
3.I am not sure if I can use file 50states and cat its content to a new file. If this is not allowed, I would a create long string array with names of 50 states, but which is not concise .

##Problem 2
1.This program looks like hard to me since I have never used go programming language before, but I tried to break the task down into small steps.
-read command line
-read file
-find duplicate
-write file
2.I learned the basic golang in a few hours and writing these code did not take me  very long. I think golang is very easy to read and easy to write.

##Problem 3
1.I have some concerns about this program. I can successfully run the program on the url provided on github, but when I run this on other website, some html code will count towards word frequency.
2.I think I can solve this problem but it may take a few days. I am new to golang but I would like to learn new programming languages and accept new challenges.
